In this class, we discussed the general structure of a sensor, which is typically composed of three main components: Controller, System, and Measurement unit
A key question that came up during the discussion was:
“Why do we write scripts?”
The answer emphasized that scripting is mainly for automation — it helps simplify tasks and reduce manual effort, enabling systems or users to perform repetitive processes more efficiently.
We also touched upon the concept of feedback, which is: inherent in both natural and engineered systems
One of the basic building blocks of automation
2. Understanding Network Systems
In the following class, we shifted focus to how network systems work. We explored the data transmission process and how different layers of the network function.
The source of a network can be a satellite, cable, etc.
For example, in a network like JIO, the data is transmitted as optical signals to application-level services (like messaging apps), which then relay the data to specific servers (e.g., Gmail).
Key concepts discussed:
Network layers include the physical layer, IP layer, and the use of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
Firewalls serve as a protective mechanism — they conceal and secure parts of a network
Data is not disrupted by magnetic disturbances, a common misconception we clarified
The network follows a client-server architecture:
Clients are remote processors that send requests
Servers handle and respond to those requests
Routes are defined as the pathways through which data packets travel across various layers of the network.
