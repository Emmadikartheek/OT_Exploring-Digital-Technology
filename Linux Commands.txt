In this session, we delved into Linux, an open-source operating system we had some exposure to in a previous course. It shares this open-source nature with operating systems like Windows and macOS, although Linux is more prominently used in areas such as cloud storage, database management, and server-side systems.
Some key features of Linux include:
Free and open-source – there’s no cost for using it.
Low susceptibility to viruses, making it a secure OS.
Highly customizable – users can modify it to suit their preferences and workflows. This flexibility was one aspect I personally found most appealing.

We are currently using the Ubuntu distribution of Linux, and as a beginner, I found it fairly intuitive and accessible.
Basic Linux commands introduced:
mkdir – Creates a new directory (folder)
ls – Lists all files and directories in the current folder
cd – Changes the directory to another path
rm – Permanently deletes files or folders
mv – Moves or renames files or folders
exit – Closes the terminal session

4. Functional Units of a Computer
We then transitioned into a discussion on the major functional units of a computer, which work together to perform tasks and process information. The five main units discussed were:
Input Unit – Devices like keyboard and mouse that provide input to the system
Output Unit – Monitors, printers, etc., which display or produce the output
Memory Unit – Stores data and instructions (includes RAM, ROM)
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) – Handles all arithmetic and logical operations
Control Unit – Directs the flow of data and coordinates operations across other units

This foundational overview helps us understand how hardware and software interact at the system level.
