This week, we had two continuous classes where we gave group presentations. Our topic was “Output Devices.”
We began by explaining what output devices are — basically, these are hardware components that receive data from a computer and convert it into a human-readable form (like visual, audio, or physical formats).
We covered the main types of output devices, such as:
Monitor/Screen – displays visuals and text; we also discussed types like LCD, LED, OLED.
Printers – used for physical copies of digital documents (we explained types like inkjet, laser, and 3D printers).
Speakers and Headphones – for audio output.
Projectors – used for displaying output on a larger screen, useful in presentations and classrooms.
We also added real-life examples for each device and explained how they are used in everyday tasks. Each group member presented one category and explained it with images or demonstrations wherever possible.
We ended with a short summary discussing the importance of output devices in completing the information processing cycle — how they are essential for users to interact with and understand what the computer is doing.
