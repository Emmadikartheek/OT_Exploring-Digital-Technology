At the start of the course, we were asked to observe and list the various technological devices present around our campus. 
After compiling the list, we sorted them into categories based on how they functionâ€”such as solar-powered, electrically operated, or digitally controlled devices.
We also learned practical skills, like how to properly compose and format emails using Google Docs and Sheets.
The course introduced us to key components of email communication, including the use of Cc and Bcc fields. 
We were taught how to write professional and well-structured emails, which is an essential skill in both academic and professional settings.
I wrote a professioal mail to my friends as part of this.
